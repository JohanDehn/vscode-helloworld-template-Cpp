A template project for Visual Studio Code, C++ language running on POP!_OS 22.04 LTS (based on Ubuntu 22.04).

Since there is lots of step-by-step setups but no templates, I made my own template for my projects, and I am sharing it with you. 
The template has been setup with a build task, and debugger launch file.
Enjoy!
